* Welcome to the DarthHelmut NixOS Repository
This repository houses my personal, modular, and reproducible NixOS configuration files. It is designed to help you set up and customize your NixOS system using declarative configurations, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.

* Overview
This repository is built around several key principles:

- **Modularity** :: Each component of the configuration is broken into manageable, logically separated modules.
- **Reproducibility** :: Leverage the power of NixOS to recreate your system exactly as defined.
- **Monitoring & Optimization** :: Integrated support for various monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Netdata) alongside system optimization tweaks.

Whether you're setting up a personal desktop or configuring servers, these files provide a robust starting point.

* Getting Started

** Prerequisites
- **NixOS** :: A system running NixOS (the unstable channel is recommended).
- **Familiarity with Nix** :: Basic knowledge of the Nix language and declarative configuration.

** Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
