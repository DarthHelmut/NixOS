# NixOS Configuration

Welcome to the **NixOS Configuration** repository by DarthHelmut. This repository houses my personal, modular, and reproducible NixOS configuration files. It is designed to help you set up and customize your NixOS system using declarative configurations, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance on your systems.

## Overview

This repository is built around several key principles:

- **Modularity:** Each component of the configuration is broken into manageable, logically separated modules.
- **Reproducibility:** Leverage the power of NixOS to recreate your system exactly as defined.
- **Monitoring & Optimization:** Integrated support for various monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Netdata) alongside system optimization tweaks.

Whether you're setting up a personal desktop or configuring servers, these files provide a robust starting point.
